# Preparation & Prerequisites

To successfully use this guide, ensure you meet the following requirements.

## Knowledge Assumptions

You should have a good understanding of the following concepts and be able to apply them:

-   **Basic Probability:** Understanding the formula $p = P(X > u)$, where $p$ represents the probability of a random variable $X$ exceeding a specific threshold $u$.
-   **Distribution Functions:** Familiarity with how data is distributed and how to identify different distribution models.
-   **Climate Risk**: General awareness of recent developments and findings in climate change risks.

## Data Requirements

When working with extreme events, your choice of statistical model is critical and depends heavily on the event of interest:

-   **Avoid Normal Distributions**: Standard normal or Gaussian distributions are often unsuitable for extreme events. However, a normal distribution may be applicable when studying certain events, such as mean seasonal temperatures, as they are generally "light-tailed" variables.

-   **Prioritize Extreme Value Theory (EVT)**: Use EVT for analysis because it is designed to handle heavy-tailed data and values that exceed a specific threshold.

### Data Consistency Notice

Effective use of Extreme Event Attribution requires that you have data for the same random variable ($X$) collected or modeled across two distinct scenarios: the **factual** world and the **counterfactual** world.
