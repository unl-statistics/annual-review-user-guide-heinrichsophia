# Preparation & Prerequisites

## Knowledge Assumptions

List the required knowledge in basic probability ($p = P(X > u)$), distribution functions, and recent climate risk findings.

## Data Requirements

Explain the necessity of having data for the same random variable (X) across two scenarios.

Guidance on Distribution: Mention why Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is preferred for heavy-tailed "rare" events over normal distributions.
