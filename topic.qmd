For my user guide, I'm going to provided a tutorial on calculating Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR). These metrics are fundamental parts of Extreme Event Attribution (EEA). The significance of FAR and RR in climate science is that they are some of the primary metrics used to communicate climate risk to stakeholders.

Ok. Make sure you connect them appropriately to the climate risk issue, and you may want to also look at different ways to visualize climate risk - Lace Padilla has some good stuff on that.
